# Daily Journal Template for Obsidian

This is a template for your daily journalling in Obsidian. I will explain the template briefly.

First you will see a YAML format properties in checkbox style that will only accept two value: `true` and `false`. Then, for banner use "Pixel Banner" and customize the banner as per your preference.

After properties, there is a permanent "Title" for your daily journal. It can be anything, from a motivational quote to your cat's nickname. Choose whatever suits you.

Then there is "Mandatory Everyday Tasks" that you need to perform. Such as "Touch grass" and "Calling you parents/partner". There is a "Notes" section too for journalling whatever happened during those tasks.

"Tasks for Today" is a section that you will update every morning or evening. It is very self explanatory.

"Journal" section comes for you to finally write about your day. Add a timestamp (24 hr clock recommended), e.g., 17:45. And then below it write your day. You can journal multiple times at different time intervals.

Then comes the day's "Positive Actions", "Negative Actions", and "Reflection/Affirmation" section. This section helps you to summarise the positives and negatives you did on that day. This can act as a tracker for you to understand whether you are going in the right direction or not. For example, a positive action can be workout, study, etc., and a negative action can be masturbation, doing drugs, etc.

Finally, in "Today's Notes" you can write what worked well today, what failed and what reminder you would like to have for tomorrow. This again can be motivational quote or the energy you are feeling at the end of the day or a your favourite movie quote.

Copy the template and paste it in `Templates/template.md` You can alter the template as per your preferences. Hope you enjoy. Check out my GitHub for more exciting stuff.
